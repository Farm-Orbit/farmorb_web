# Farmorb Product Roadmap
## Comprehensive Livestock Management System

### Executive Summary

Farmorb is evolving from a farm and team collaboration platform into a comprehensive livestock management system. This roadmap outlines the strategic development plan to integrate advanced livestock tracking, health management, breeding programs, and analytics while maintaining the existing team collaboration foundation.

## 1. Product Vision & Positioning

### Mission Statement

Farmorb provides livestock farmers with a comprehensive digital platform to manage their operations, from individual animal health to herd performance analytics, enabling data-driven decisions and improved profitability.

### Target Market

- **Small-scale livestock farmers** (1-50 animals)
- **Medium commercial operations** (51-500 animals)  
- **Large-scale farms** (500+ animals)
- **Agricultural cooperatives**
- **Dairy, beef cattle, sheep, goat, and pig farmers**

### Market Context

- **Global farm management software market**: $3.56B (2022) → $7.28B (2027)
- **North America holds 38% market share**
- **Key trend**: Precision agriculture and data analytics adoption
- **Competition**: FarmLogs, AgriWebb, CattleMax, Herdsman

## 2. System Architecture Integration

### Hierarchical Structure (Market Standard)

```
Farm (existing)
  ├── Farm Members (existing)
  ├── Farm Invitations (existing)
  └── Herds/Groups (NEW)
        └── Animals (NEW)
              ├── Health Records
              ├── Breeding Records
              ├── Feeding Records
              └── Movement History
```

### How It Connects

- Each **Farm** (existing) can have multiple **Herds/Groups**
- Herds organize animals by: location, purpose, age group, or species
- Examples: "Dairy Herd A", "Breeding Bulls", "Weaners Pen 3"
- **Farm Members** (existing) can access all herds within their assigned farms
- Permissions cascade: Farm Owner → full access, Farm Member → view/limited edit

## 9. Poultry Integration Strategy (Future-Ready Architecture)

### Built-in Poultry Compatibility

The current architecture is designed to seamlessly support poultry management when ready:

#### Flexible Herd/Group Structure
```sql
herds (
  farm_id,
  name,           -- "Dairy Herd A" OR "Laying Hens"
  purpose,        -- "dairy" OR "egg_production" 
  species_type,   -- "mammal" OR "poultry"
  location,       -- "Pasture 1" OR "Chicken Coop A"
  created_at
)
```

#### Adaptable Animal Tracking
```sql
animals (
  herd_id,
  tag_id,                    -- Individual ear tag OR batch number
  name,                      -- "Bella" OR "Batch-2024-001"
  species,                   -- "cattle" OR "chicken"
  tracking_type,             -- "individual" OR "batch"
  birth_date,
  -- ... other fields
)
```

### Migration Path: Mammals → Poultry

#### Phase 1: Build Mammal System (Current Plan)
- Use the existing schema as-is
- Focus on individual animal tracking
- Perfect the herd management UI

#### Phase 2: Add Poultry Support (When Ready)
- Add `species_type` field to herds
- Add `tracking_type` field to animals  
- Create poultry-specific UI components
- Add batch management features

#### Phase 3: Mixed Farm Support
- Unified dashboard showing both species
- Species-specific workflows
- Cross-species analytics

### Competitive Advantage
- **Most competitors are single-species focused**
- **Many farms are diversified** (cattle + chickens)
- **Easy market expansion** (start with mammals, add poultry later)
- **Future-proof system** (one platform for all livestock)
